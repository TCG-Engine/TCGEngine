# TCGEngine — Repo Instructions & Developer Guide

This document provides a concise developer-oriented guide to the repository, with focused guidance for editing Decision Queue and Turn / Next-Turn code paths. Keep this file updated as you change behavior or generator outputs.

## Quick links (files to know)
- `Core/DecisionQueueController.php` — server-side logic that executes static decision-queue entries and invokes custom handlers.
- `Core/UILibraries.js` — client-side rendering pipeline used by the generated UI (PopulateZone, createCardHTML, card injection points).
- `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` — schema parser + code generator that produces server helpers and a `GeneratedUI_*.js` client helper.
- `Schemas/<RootName>/GameSchema.txt` — schema defining zones, overlays, counters and display properties.
- `<RootName>/GeneratedUI_*.js` — generated client helpers (watch for the timestamped filename in the game folder).
- `<RootName>/ZoneAccessors.php`, `ZoneClasses.php`, `GamestateParser.php` — generated server-side gamestate helpers.
- `<RootName>/GetNextTurn.php`, `NextTurnRender.php`, `InitialLayout.php` — important generated files used by runtime.
- `<RootName>/Custom/*` (e.g. `RBSim/Custom/GameLogic.php`) — custom game logic where customDQHandlers are normally registered.

## High-level flow
1. Authoritative schema: `Schemas/<Root>/GameSchema.txt`.
2. Run the generator: `zzGameCodeGenerator.php?rootName=<Root>` (open via your dev host or run via CLI if you have a local PHP webserver). The generator parses the schema and writes the generated PHP files and the client `GeneratedUI_<timestamp>.js` into `./<Root>`.
3. The frontend includes `InitialLayout.php` and the generated `GeneratedUI_*.js`. The `GeneratedUI_*.js` contains `GetZoneData()`, `OverlayRules`, `CounterRules`, and other generated helpers.
4. `Core/UILibraries.js` (client) uses those helpers to render zones (`PopulateZone`) and per-card HTML (`createCardHTML`). We inject counters and overlays at well-known insertion points in `createCardHTML`.

If you change the schema or generator, re-run the generator and hard-refresh the browser so the client receives the updated `GeneratedUI_*.js` (the generator deletes old `GeneratedUI_*.js` files and writes a new timestamped one).

## Decision Queue — server-side (how it works)
- File: `Core/DecisionQueueController.php`.
- Core concept: each player has a `DecisionQueue` zone (parsed from schema). Objects placed into that zone are processed by `DecisionQueueController::ExecuteStaticMethods()` to perform static, immediate actions that do not require interactive input.

Key points:
- `ExecuteStaticMethods($player, $lastDecision)` iterates the player's queue and handles specific decision Types (e.g., `MZMOVE`, `CUSTOM`).
- For `CUSTOM` decisions the code currently does:

  - split the `Param` string on `|` to produce parts
  - `array_shift` the first element to get the handler name
  - call the registered handler with signature: `$customDQHandlers[$handlerName]($player, $parts, $lastDecision)`

  So: the handler receives `$player` (int), `$parts` (an array of the remaining params — reindexed starting at 0), and `$lastDecision` (string|null). This is the canonical place to add short, non-interactive flows.

How to add a custom handler
1. Register handlers in your game's custom logic file (e.g. `RBSim/Custom/GameLogic.php`) near where `$customDQHandlers` is defined. Example:

```php
$customDQHandlers = [];
$customDQHandlers["DealDamage"] = function($player, $params, $lastDecision) {
    // $params is an array of strings (the parts after the handler name)
    // Example usage: $targetZone = $params[0]; $amount = intval($params[1]);
    // Implement small, stateless actions here. Keep them short and idempotent.
};
```

2. When you queue the decision (AddDecision) ensure the `Param` string format matches how the handler expects it: e.g. `DealDamage|myBattlefield-3|2` (handlerName|targetMZ|amount). The generator/renderer may serialize things differently; inspect how decisions are enqueued in your game flow.

Important notes and gotchas
- `ExecuteStaticMethods` will `PopDecision($player)` after executing the recognized static action — make sure handlers do not assume the decision remains in the queue.
- Only use `CUSTOM` static handlers for short immediate changes; interactive decisions should use other decision Types (YESNO, MZCHOOSE, etc.).
- Handlers must be tolerant of malformed parameters (validate array indexes, numeric conversion). Prefer failing silently and logging rather than throwing unhandled exceptions that could kill the loop.

## Turn controller / generator notes
- The generator (`zzGameCodeGenerator.php`) outputs a number of server files and a key client JS file (`GeneratedUI_<timestamp>.js`). Important generator behaviours:
  - It emits `OverlayRules` and `CounterRules` as `const` JS objects in the generated JS. Client code reads these constants for overlays/counters.
  - It emits zone metadata accessible by `GetZoneData(zoneName)` on the client.
  - It deletes old `GeneratedUI_*.js` files in the target folder and writes a new timestamped copy.

## Where to change things (map of responsibilities)
- Decision queue static behavior: `Core/DecisionQueueController.php::ExecuteStaticMethods()`
- Register game-specific handlers: `<RootName>/Custom/GameLogic.php` (see `$customDQHandlers` array)
- Generator parsing & code emission: `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` (Counters, Overlays, Zone metadata, GeneratedUI emission)
- Client rendering: `Core/UILibraries.js` (PopulateZone, createCardHTML, CreateCountersHTML, overlays injection)
- Endpoint that serves next-turn data: generated `<RootName>/GetNextTurn.php` (see `zzGameCodeGenerator.php` which writes this file)

## Card Ability Implementation Workflow (for AI agents)

This is the canonical workflow for implementing card abilities. Follow these steps in order.

### CRITICAL RULES
- **NEVER manually edit `<RootName>/GeneratedCode/GeneratedMacroCode.php`** — this file is auto-generated from the database. The MCP `save_card_abilities` tool saves to the DB and triggers the code generator automatically. Any manual edits will be overwritten.
- **NEVER manually edit `<RootName>/GeneratedCode/GeneratedMacroCount.js`** — same reason.
- Helper functions that don't already exist should be added to the appropriate file in `<RootName>/Custom/` based on theme (e.g. combat helpers in CombatLogic.php, general helpers in GameLogic.php).
- **Per-card stat modifiers** — continuous effects that raise/lower a single card's POWER, HP, or Level should be implemented by:
  1. Using `AddTurnEffect($mzCard, $effectID)` to tag the card with the effect when the ability resolves.
  2. Adding a `case "$effectID":` to the relevant `ObjectCurrentPower`, `ObjectCurrentHP`, or `ObjectCurrentLevel` switch in `GameLogic.php`.
  The effect is automatically cleared at end of turn by `ExpireEffects`.
- **Field-presence passives** (e.g. "champion gets +1 level while you control X") belong in `ObjectCurrentLevel`/`ObjectCurrentPower`/`ObjectCurrentHP`. Use the established pattern: loop the field once, switch on card ID, deduplicate with `$appliedPassives[$fID]` to prevent duplicate copies from stacking inadvertently.

### Step 1: Gather card information
Call the MCP `get_card_info` tool with the card ID to get the card's name, effect text, element, type, cost, and other metadata.

### Step 2: Discover the zone schema
Call the MCP `get_zone_schema` tool to understand what properties exist on cards in each zone. Key facts for Grand Archive:
- **Field zone** has: `CardID`, `Status` (1=exhausted, 2=ready), `Owner`, `Damage` (integer counter), `Controller`, `TurnEffects` (array of effect IDs)
- Champions are on the Field, just like allies. They are distinguished by `CardType == "CHAMPION"`.
- Champion damage is tracked via the `Damage` property on the champion object in the field, NOT via `GetHealth()`. The `Health` zone is a legacy artifact.
- **Memory zone** has only: `CardID`
- **Graveyard, Hand, Deck** have only: `CardID`

### Step 3: Find existing helper functions
Call the MCP `get_helper_functions` tool to discover what helper functions already exist. Search with relevant terms. Key helpers for Grand Archive include:
- `ZoneSearch(zoneName, cardTypes, floatingMemoryOnly, cardElements, cardSubtypes)` — search a zone by type/element/subtype. All params after `zoneName` are optional and can be passed by name (e.g. `ZoneSearch("myField", ["ALLY"], cardSubtypes: ["ANIMAL", "BEAST"])`).
- `DealChampionDamage(player, amount)` — add damage to the player's champion on the field
- `RecoverChampion(player, amount)` — remove damage from the player's champion on the field
- `DealDamage(player, source, target, amount)` — deal damage from a source to a target (via macro)
- `Draw(player, amount)` — draw cards (macro call, preferred over DoDrawCard)
- `MZMove(player, mzCard, destZone)` — move a card between zones
- `IsClassBonusActive(player, classes)` — check if champion's class matches
- `AddGlobalEffects(player, effectID)` — add a global effect that affects all matching cards this turn (via `doesGlobalEffectApply` / `CardCurrentEffects`)
- `AddTurnEffect(mzCard, effectID)` — add a per-card turn effect to a specific field card's `TurnEffects` array. Use this when the effect targets a single card (e.g. "+2 POWER until end of turn on a specific ally") rather than `AddGlobalEffects` which broadcasts to all matching cards. The effect ID is conventionally the source card's ID. It is cleared at end of turn by `ExpireEffects`.
- `ExhaustCard(player, mzID)` — exhaust a card
- `WakeupCard(player, mzID)` — ready a card
- `ObjectCurrentPower(obj)`, `ObjectCurrentHP(obj)` — get computed stats
- `CardElement(cardID)`, `CardType(cardID)`, `CardClasses(cardID)` — card dictionary lookups

### Step 4: Study existing examples
Call the MCP `get_implemented_examples` tool with the relevant macro name (e.g. "CardActivated", "Enter") to see how similar abilities are coded. This shows you the exact pattern to follow.

### Step 5: Write the ability code
Write ONLY the function body (not the closure wrapper). The code generator wraps it in the appropriate `$macroAbilities["cardID:0"] = function($player) { ... }` closure automatically. The code can use:
- `$player` — the player who owns/activated the card
- `DecisionQueueController::GetVariable("mzID")` — the mzID of the card (auto-retrieved by generator)
- Any helper functions from Step 3
- **Await syntax** for player choices:
  - `$var = await $player.MZChoose("zone-0&zone-1")` — mandatory card choice
  - `$var = await $player.MZMayChoose("zone-0&zone-1")` — optional card choice
  - `$var = await $player.YesNo("prompt")` — yes/no choice
  - `await FunctionName($player, $args)` — call a function that queues decisions

### Step 6: Save via MCP
Call `save_card_abilities` with the card ID, macro name, and ability code. The MCP server saves to the database AND automatically runs the code generator, so `GeneratedMacroCode.php` is updated.

### Step 7: Add any new helper functions
If the card requires a new helper function (like `RecoverChampion`), add it to the appropriate Custom/*.php file. Group by theme:
- Combat-related → `CombatLogic.php`
- Materialize-related → `MaterializeLogic.php`
- General game logic → `GameLogic.php`
- Card-specific complex logic → `CardLogic.php`
